# Dice

https://lindsma.github.io/Dice/

## Week 3 

#### Objective: 
Create a dice game where the object is to "roll" a seven or eleven combined between two dice. You'll need to create an HTML file, and some basic Sass to create a page that looks like the mockup below.

The JavaScript for the game must do the following:
* Use an object to represent your game
  * Your object should store:
    * the start date/time of the game
    * an array of the game rounds
    (Each round lasts until the user wins, so one round should have the start time of that round plus the number of rolls of        the dice that have occurred for that round.)
